# Join the Fresns Community

This document is for developers who want to join Fresns open-source organization. If you are only a user, please read the [guide](../guide/) document; if you are a developer of an extension plug-in, please read the [extension](https://docs.fresns.com/open-source/extensions/) documentation; if you are a mobile application developer, please read the [API](https://docs.fresns.com/clients/api/) documentation.

The open-source community of Fresns is growing rapidly. If you recognize our open-source software and are interested in contributing to the development of Fresns, we sincerely welcome you to join us to develop and improve it.

## Normative Standards

### Code of Conduct

Our [Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/zh-cn/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/) is a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

### Feedback Specification

This [feedback specification](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs-cn.html) can inform you of how to write an effective feedback report and help us improve communication efficiency.

### Contributing Specification

We appreciate small, focused PRs. If you'd like to make an extremely large change, please communicate with team members prior to a pull request. Here's a [writeup that details why this is so critical](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/03/31/how-to-scope-down-prs/) for us to work well on this team. Please understand that though we always appreciate contributions, ultimately we have to prioritize what works best for the project as a whole.

## What You Can Do

### Contribute Code

As with any project, there are rules to contributing. To ensure that we can help you or accept your pull request as quickly as possible, please read [the contributing guide](/contributing/).

After that, you'll be ready to contribute to Fresns core repositories:

- [Fresns](https://github.com/fresns/fresns): the core library
- [Plugins](https://github.com/fresns/plugins): officially developed extension plugins
- [Themes](https://github.com/fresns/client-website-themes): officially developed website themes repository

...as well as many smaller official [companion libraries](https://github.com/fresns).

### Share (and Build) Your Experience

Apart from answering questions and sharing resources in the [Community](https://discuss.fresns.org/), there are a few other less obvious ways to share and extend what you know:

- **Develop learning materials.** It's often said that the best way to learn is to teach. If there's something interesting you're doing with Fresns, strengthen your expertise by writing a blog post, developing a workshop, or even publishing a gist that you share on social media.
- **Watch a repo you care about.** This will send you notifications whenever there's activity in that repository, giving you insider knowledge about ongoing discussions and upcoming features. It's a fantastic way to build expertise so that you're eventually able to help address issues and pull requests.

### Translate Docs

I hope that right now, you're reading this sentence in your preferred language. If not, would you like to help us get there?

See the [Translations guide](../contributing/translations.md) for more details on how you can get involved.
