Applications developed using the [Fresns API](/api/) can take various forms, such as standalone websites, mobile apps, WeChat mini-programs, and quick applications. Should the core program's API not meet specific requirements, there's the option to install or develop additional applications to expand the API capabilities or manage related configurations for the client-side.

## Web Client

- **Standalone Deploy**: If your client is a standalone deployment such as Vue, React, Flutter or other technical solutions, it is just as easy to read the [API documentation](/api/) as it is for an app.
- **Run in Fresns(theme)**: The integrated web client that runs in Fresns uses the [Laravel Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/blade) template engine and follows the Blade feature and view files.

## App Client

- Please read the [API documentation](/api/) to develop an app client based directly on the API.
