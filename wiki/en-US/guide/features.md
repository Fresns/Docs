# Features

## Lightweight and concise

It is functionally flexible and diverse enough to make any currently known social product feature available. The main program is very lightweight and concise, in which extensions are configured and installed as needed. Unwanted functions will not appear to interfere with your use. The functions you need can be used in the background, or in the foreground in a WYSIWYG manner, or even independently from the main program.

## Full cross-platform support

Whether it is on a Web site, a mini program, a fast application, or a client such as iOS and Android, it can support the cross-platform operation of management control and multiform content, and realize unified, universal and standard integrated services.

## Support multiple languages

Multiple languages are supported from the data stream level, and various languages can be added at ease without modifying main programs, themes, plug-ins and clients. It supports 187 languages in 239 countries/regions around the world (the data strategy conforms to the laws and regulations of all regions in the world), and supports any language and time zone with a simple configuration in the background.

## Support optional engines and templates

The website engine and theme template can be separately optional and redeveloped, and multilingual SEO configuration is natively supported. No matter in which language environment you run or switch, you do not need to worry about search engine inclusion. It is also so flexible in operation and deployment that you can choose integrated deployment or independent deployment like App, and even support the deployment of multiple sites with the same engine or different engines, enabling differentiated operations of a set of data in multiple functional forms.

## Flexible technology architecture

The main program contains no personalized requirements but is operation-oriented, and can be flexibly modified based on business needs. The main program that is not solidified is not constrained by any engine in its function. It is very flexible and convenient for use and secondary development without affecting the main program. Your customized function will not be overwritten or affected even when the main program is updated. With this flexible technical architecture, you can always focus on your operational direction during use without worrying that your changes will affect future upgrades.

## Horizontal menu mode

The user’s perception of a product’s function (sense of space) does not depend on the URL, but primarily at the UE and UI levels (breadcrumb navigation). To this end, the product adopts the horizontal menu mode, and any page is not limited to the parent or can be the parent to make the first-level page. In this way, the menu level is no longer differentiated by hierarchy, but is completely determined by the theme and client used by the user, becoming more convenient for configuration and more flexible for customization.

## Back-end naming control

The user’s perception of a product’s service (sense of experience) does not depend on the technical logic, but on the naming of function points. Therefore, any function point of a product can be customized with a name in the background. Any function point and description point from the content of user data to interaction behaviors can be named in a customized manner (supporting multiple languages). By naming, users’ cognition of products can be shaped (without modifying main programs, themes, plug-ins, clients), and various operation scenarios can be realized.

## Public and private modes

The operation mode of the site can be public or private. In the private mode, you can create your own secret circle, and can join in various ways such as invitation, payment, Q&A. If you want to extend the independent gameplay, the product also reserves the More Json extension from the database to the interface level, allowing you to define new parameters at will. By combining the matching theme and client, you can realize the features of any currently known social products.

## Various product models and forms

The product supports the features of any known social products in terms of structure and content form, including but not limited to modes such as Blog, CMS, BBS, Wiki, SNS, list, and can be implemented in the forms of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, LinkedIn, etc.

## Extensible user functionality

It supports extensible user functions such as multi-user, multi-role, multi-icon, multi-color, multi-score, anonymity, avatar pendant, and wallet. After opening, it can be used by all members or designated roles. Multi-user and multi-role can be used in vest, sub-brand, assistant and other user scenarios; multi-icon can be used in exhibition icon scenes such as medals, badges, status, interaction achievements, and user status. Moreover, multi-icon also supports binding functions, and can be used in functional icon scenes such as “shop window”, “secret tree hole”, “ask me a question”.

## Flexibly extensible content forms

Thanks to the mechanism of data stream plug-in, you can realize a variety of content forms by installing editor plug-ins, such as voting, Q&A, voice, merchandise, reward, debate, activity, live broadcast, book audio and video, interaction game (example: You Draw I Guess), paid reading, password reading, designated user or user role reading and so on.

## Highly componentized

It is configured with front-end and back-end separation, as well as dynamic and static separation architecture, which supports independent deployment of any components. For example, modules such as registration, login, publishing, editor, personal center, and management background can be independently deployed or integrated into the existing main program, and binding custom domain names are supported. Highly flexible architecture allows you to choose your favorite functions, and even customize the management background (other schemes can be selected in the background). A high degree of componentization can not only enrich the extension of functions, but also prevent the intrusion of advertising robots. With the flexible deployment mode comes a non-standardized entry, which makes the addresses of key operations more random and irregular and impossible for robots to start with.

## Cross-language support

If you want to implement social features in your existing product, you don’t have to go through a lot of brainstorming to redevelop a new product. Integrating Fresns directly will not only save a lot of time and cost, but also realize many ready-made extensions. In addition, Fresns considers the cross-language data flow logic when planning the data structure. In other words, Fresns always supports your product development needs from the bottom level, even if you want to develop in a different programming language in the future, or run in a mixture of multiple programming languages. No matter how updated your product is in the future, you don’t have to worry about programming languages.

## Support externally applied load algorithm

If you need a personalized data list, you can develop or install the corresponding algorithm plug-in by yourself to make the data output more personalized. For example, if all kinds of content such as pictures, videos, commodities, and documents need to output results that meet the user’s preferences, it is not only necessary to build a user’s preference portrait, but also has higher requirements for retrieval engines. When the main program cannot meet your needs, you can load the specified plug-in externally without modifying the main program, themes, plug-ins, and clients.

## Support data stream subscription

Plug-ins can subscribe to the data flow dynamics, and can realize the function extension at the data flow level regardless of whether the client is Web or App. For example, when users publish content or upload files, plug-ins will receive subscription notification and wake up, and can perform various functional behaviors such as content security check, notification to administrators for review or random reward.

## Design idea of command word frame

Fresns designs an original “command word” framework based on the RPC idea of large-scale service systems. In this way, the network communication programming model is realized by command word, which reduces the complexity of processing network data, improves the flexibility of main program and plug-in mechanism, and makes the interaction between cross-business and plug-ins more convenient. From the subsequent framework extension, the single framework can support multiple plug-ins. It can not only support multi-system and multi-plug-in mode, but also realize distributed call between systems in micro-service mode. Command word is not only flexible in communication, but also convenient for upgrading. When the main program business or database changes, there is no need for plug-in linkage upgrade, and even when running across programming languages or SaaS, command words can be compatible.
